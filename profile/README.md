```

**3.** Navigate to the project directory.

	git push origin YourBranchName
```

**8.** Create a [PR](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)


**Note:** If anyone contributes to this repository, the changes will not be reflected in your local repository. For that:

**9.** Setup a reference(remote) to the original repository to get all the changes from the remote.

```bash
	git remote add upstream  https://github.com/Campo-Yangu/campus-tech-blog.git
```

**10.** Check the remotes for this repository.

```bash
	git remote -v
```

**11.** Fetching from the remote repository will bring in its branches and their respective commits.

```bash
	git fetch upstream
```

**12.** Make sure that you're on your master branch.

```bash
	git checkout main
```

**13.** Now that you have fetched the upstream repository, you can merge its changes into our local branch. This will bring that branch into sync with the upstream, without losing the local changes.

```bash
	git merge upstream/main
```
